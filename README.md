I have dedicated seven years to my role as a practicing accountant, gaining experience across three distinct industries in the Philippines. 
Throughout this professional journey, which predominantly involved working with large corporations, I have cultivated expertise in various areas of accounting, 
including bookkeeping, financial analysis and reporting, and taxation, both within the Philippines and Australian settings. 
My proficiency extends to using financial software systems such as SAP FICO and Xero Accounting.

My career sparked a deep curiosity about the potential of financial and accounting data, 
especially when combined with external factors such as customer information, economic conditions, environmental variables, and others. 
I realized that decision-makers could benefit significantly from a broader perspective beyond relying solely on current and historical financial data. 
This curiosity led me to the idea of integrating my financial background into data analysis.

I have recently earned a graduate certificate, which introduced me to essential tools such as Python, Tableau, Power BI, and R. 
Although the program provided a foundation in these technologies, I am still in the process of refining my skills and deepening my knowledge in their application. 
My aim is to leverage these enhanced capabilities to provide decision-makers with a more comprehensive understanding of their options and outcomes, 
moving beyond traditional financial metrics.
